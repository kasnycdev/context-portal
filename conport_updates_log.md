# ConPort Context Updates - Comprehensive Testing Session

## Decision: SSE Transport for All Project Testing

**Summary:** SPRINT_TESTING_TRANSPORT_DECISION

**Rationale:** During comprehensive tool validation, SSE transport proved unreliable due to Python virtual environment configuration issues. STDIO transport demonstrated 100% reliability with all 30 ConPort MCP tools tested successfully.

- **Performance:** STDIO transport completed testing of 30 tools systematically with zero communication failures
- **Reliability:** Avoided complex SSE bridge configuration that introduced Python path resolution issues
- **Simplicity:** Direct JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout eliminates network dependencies

**Implementation:** Standard STDIO MCP transport for all project testing scenarios.

## Decision: Simplified Python Command Usage

**Summary:** PYTHON_COMMAND_SIMPLIFICATION_DECISION

**Rationale:** Updated all codebase references to use simple "python" command instead of hardcoded virtual environment paths. This makes the project more portable and works correctly within activated virtual environments.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `test_all_conport_tools.py` (main test script)
- Updated `server.js` (node.js bridge server)
- Updated `simple_http_test.py` (HTTP transport test)
- Result: 96.8% tool testing success rate maintained (30/31 tools passing)

**Implementation:** Command line calls use "python" - relies on proper PYTHONPATH/virtualenv activation.

## System Pattern: Comprehensive MCP Tool Testing

**System Name:** CONPORT_COMPREHENSIVE_TOOL_VALIDATION

**Description:** Established robust testing pattern for validating all 30 ConPort MCP tools systematically. The pattern ensures complete tool coverage with proper error handling for expected failures (delete operations on non-existent items).

**Pattern Structure:**
1. **Initialization:** MCP protocol handshake and tool listing
2. **Systematic Testing:** All tools tested by category in logical order
3. **Error Classification:** Distinguishes between actual errors and expected failures
4. **Result Aggregation:** Comprehensive success/failure reporting with detailed breakdowns

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses STDIO transport for direct subprocess communication
- Catches expected errors (e.g., "delete" operations on missing items)
- Returns detailed metrics: tool counts, success rates, error details

## System Pattern: Docker Setup Streamlining

**System Name:** DOCKER_CONTAINER_OPTIMIZATION

**Description:** Streamlined Docker configuration for both development and production deployment of ConPort MCP server. Multi-stage builds reduce image size while maintaining full Python/Node.js dependencies.

**Key Features:**
1. **Production Image Size:** Multi-stage build reduces final image size
2. **Security:** Non-root user, proper permission management
3. **Health Checks:** Built-in health monitoring for container orchestration
4. **Persistent Data:** Volume mounting for workspace/context data
5. **Development Override:** Support for source mounting and debugging

**Docker Architecture:**
- **Base Images:** Node.js for runtime, Python for backend processing
- **Service:** Single container running both Node.js bridge and Python MCP server
- **Networks:** Isolated MCP network for secure communication
- **Health Checks:** HTTP endpoint validation with proper timeout/retries
